*Myna for PHP* is an [open-source](https://github.com/myna/myna-php/) PHP 5.3+ client for Myna. It is designed to run on the server, integrated with custom built PHP applications, or as part of PHP-based content management systems such as Wordpress, Drupal, or Joomla.

Myna for PHP is built in several layers. The highest level provides easy to use functions for viewing and recording, with sensible defaults for cookie handling and so on. Low-levels of the code provide a complete toolkit for building your own client.
