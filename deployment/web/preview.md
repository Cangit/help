title  : Previewing Variants
---

Add `#preview` to the end of the web address on your page to show the *Myna inspector*. This allows you to preview your variants and simulate conversions without recording experiment data on your dashboard or using up your quota.

**Pro tip:** Preview mode only works once you have added the *deployment snippet* to your page (see *Getting Up and Running* above).
