If you can't do what you need with the `data-` tags in Myna for HTML, your first port of call should be one of the following:

 - If you have developers on your team, you can use [custom Javascript](javascript.html) to achieve most things.

 - If you *don't* have any developers available you can *log an issue* with us, either on our [Github page][] or via the [contact][] form on our web site.

## Custom Builds

The deployment snippet embedded on our dashboard combines the Myna client with a recent version of jQuery and all the configuration necessary for your draft and published experiments. If this content doesn't match your needs for any reason, you can grab a copy of the Myna client from our [Github page][] and integrate it with your own codebase.

Platinum customers should also [contact][] our development team for direct support with any integration work.

## Enhancing Myna

If you are a developer and you spot some great feature we're missing, please raise an issue on our [Github page][]. We may be able to add the feature to Myna ourselves or accept a pull request.
