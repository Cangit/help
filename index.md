  <p><strong>This is a work-in-progress help site for <a href="https://mynaweb.com/dashboard/v2">Myna v2</a></strong>, which is currently in public beta.</p>

  <p>
    Myna v2 is pre-release software - it is subject to change and may contain bugs and missing features. Please report any issues via our <a href="https://mynaweb.com/contact">contact page</a>.

  <p>
    In the meantime, we recommend using the <a href="https://mynaweb.com/dashboard">regular dashboard</a> for mission critical experiments until the software comes out of beta. Please refer to our <a href="https://mynaweb.com/help">existing help site</a> for support with the regular dashboard.

## What's new?

We just launched a brand new version of Myna that makes it much more powerful and easier to use. Here are the new features:

 - **Dashboard improvements** - we've completely overhauled our dashboard, providing it with additional power and flexibility:
    - *Search for experiments* by name or ID. Mark experiments as draft, published, or archived to focus on a particular stage in the lifecycle.
    - *Preview variants* directly from the dashboard using the new **Myna inspector**.

 - **Deployment improvements** - it's far easier to set up experiments on your web site:
    - New *variant settings* allow you specify colours, layouts, and text on your dashboard and use them in your HTML on your site.
    - New *deployment snippets* allow you to paste one tag into your page template to get access to all your experiments.
    - Configure experiment settings directly from the dashboard without having to access your source code.
    - Our deployment scripts are hosted on a CDN, meaning blazingly fast page load times all around the world.

 - **API improvements** - we've added new features to our API to allow developers to test anything they need to:
    - *API keys* allow you to run experiments without storing your log-in details in your code.
    - *Assign settings to experiments and variants* - remote control your experiments via our API.
    - *Override our suggested variants* when you need to - create complex experimental setups that are part Myna, part your own design.

 - **Algorithmic improvements** - we've overhauled our machine algorithms making Myna *even faster* at learning your users' preferences,
   whilst simultaneously being able to cope with a much wider set of experimental constraints.

 We've also made it possible for you to remotely tweak and configure experiments direclty from the dashboard without
