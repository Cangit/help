*Myna for Javascript*, is an [open-source](https://github.com/myna/myna-js/) Javascript client for Myna. It is designed to run in the web browser, and hence includes facilities for handling cookies and the like, but only implements the API methods needed for viewing variants and recording events.

*Myna for HTML* is a higher-level client that builds on top of Myna for Javascript and jQuery to provide an easier-to-use client for experiments that only involve changing the DOM on a web page.

Myna for Javascript is built in several layers. The highest level provides easy to use functions for viewing and recording, with sensible defaults for cookie handling and so on. Low-levels of the code provide a complete toolkit for building your own client.
